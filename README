SpritePlayground is a simple bit of Cocos2d-iPhone 1.0.1 exmaple code that shows you how to do
the following:
1. Create a "composite sprite" (a sprite made of multiple CCSprites with a parent CCNode)
2. Respond to touches
3. Rotate a sprite to face an arbitrary point on the screen
4. Instansiate a custom partical system (created via Particle Designer)
5. Use CCSequence and CCEase actions to move a sprite around the screen

This code is provided free and open source.
The sprite's graphic image is copyright John Pavley. All rights reserved.
(So just replace it with your own.)
